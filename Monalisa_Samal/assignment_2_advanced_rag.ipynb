Frameworks like LangChain offer a moderate complexity level and are suitable for general LLM applications, while AutoGPT is known for its high complexity and steep learning curve, making it ideal for autonomous tasks. CrewAI, on the other hand, has a medium complexity level with an easy learning curve, making it suitable for team collaboration. LlamaIndex stands out with low complexity and ease of use, making it a good fit for document Q&A tasks. Performance considerations show that single agents typically have lower latency compared to multi-agent systems, but the latter are often more accurate for complex tasks. However, more agents in a system can lead to higher API costs. In terms of reliability, simpler frameworks are generally more stable. When choosing the right framework, beginners may find LlamaIndex or simple LangChain suitable, while those tackling complex tasks may benefit from using AutoGPT or multi-agent systems.\n"]}],"source":["def create_query_engine_with_tree_summarize(index, top_k: int = 5):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Create a query engine that uses TreeSummarize for comprehensive responses.\n","\n","    TODO: Complete this function to create a query engine with TreeSummarize synthesis.\n","    HINT: Create a TreeSummarize instance, then use index.as_query_engine() with response_synthesizer parameter\n","\n","    Args:\n","        index: Vector index to query\n","        top_k: Number of results to retrieve\n","\n","    Returns:\n","        Query engine with TreeSummarize synthesis\n","    \"\"\"\n","    # TODO: Create TreeSummarize response synthesizer\n","    tree_synthesizer =TreeSummarize()\n","\n","    # TODO: Create query engine with the synthesizer\n","    query_engine = index.as_query_engine(\n","        response_synthesizer=tree_synthesizer,\n","        similarity_top_k=top_k\n","    )\n","\n","\n","\n","    # PLACEHOLDER - Replace with actual implementation\n","    print(f\"✅ Create query engine with TreeSummarize synthesis\")\n","\n","    return query_engine\n","\n","\n","# Test the function\n","if index:\n","    tree_engine = create_query_engine_with_tree_summarize(index)\n","\n","    if tree_engine:\n","        print(\"✅ Query engine with TreeSummarize created\")\n","\n","        # Test with a complex analytical query\n","        analytical_query = \"Compare the advantages and disadvantages of different AI agent frameworks\"\n","        print(f\"\\n🔍 Testing analytical query: '{analytical_query}'\")\n","\n","        try:\n","            response = tree_engine.query(analytical_query)\n","            print(f\"📝 TreeSummarize Response:\\n{response}\")\n","        except Exception as e:\n","            print(f\"❌ Error during query: {e}\")\n","        # Uncomment when implemented:\n","\n","\n","\n","    else:\n","        print(\"❌ Failed to create TreeSummarize query engine\")\n","else:\n","    print(\"❌ No index available - run previous cells first\")\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"abAfqxgnYchQ"},"source":["## 3.
