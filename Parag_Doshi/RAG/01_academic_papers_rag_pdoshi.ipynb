        "\n",
        "Our RAG system will include:\n",
        "1. **PDF Processing**: Extract text from academic papers\n",
        "2. **Document Chunking**: Split documents into searchable segments\n",
        "3. **Vector Embeddings**: Convert text to numerical representations\n",
        "4. **Vector Storage**: Store embeddings in LanceDB\n",
        "5. **Semantic Search**: Find relevant content for queries\n",
        "6. **Query Engine**: Generate responses using retrieved context\n"

            "The main architectural patterns for agent systems include single-agent and multi-agent architectures. Single-agent patterns focus on individual agents that may receive feedback from humans but not from other agents. Multi-agent architectures involve multiple agents that can either use the same or different language models and tools. These architectures are categorized into vertical and horizontal structures. Vertical architectures have a lead agent with other agents reporting to it, while horizontal architectures treat all agents as equals, allowing them to communicate in a shared discussion and volunteer for tasks.\n",

            "Key ethical considerations for AI agents include accountability, oversight, and value alignment. In multi-agent environments, defining accountability is crucial to prevent gaps when agents collaborate, as this can complicate responsibility assignment. Ensuring fairness is essential, particularly when agents are trained on biased data, as this can perpetuate systemic inequities. Value alignment is vital to maintain consistency between agents' actions and human intentions and ethical standards, especially in dynamic settings. Ethical governance frameworks and oversight mechanisms are necessary to address these challenges effectively.\n",

        "🎉 **Congratulations!** You have successfully built a complete RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system for academic papers using LlamaIndex.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What we accomplished:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Environment Setup**: Configured API keys and dependencies\n",
        "2. **Configuration Management**: Loaded system settings from YAML files\n",
        "3. **LlamaIndex Configuration**: Set up embeddings, LLM, and text processing\n",
        "4. **Vector Store**: Created a LanceDB vector database for storing embeddings\n",
        "5. **Document Processing**: Loaded and processed PDF academic papers\n",
        "6. **Vector Indexing**: Created searchable vector embeddings of documents\n",
        "7. **Query Engine**: Set up retrieval and response generation\n",
        "8. **Search Functions**: Implemented semantic search with metadata\n",
        "9. **Paper Analysis**: Created functions for listing and summarizing papers\n",
        "10. **Interactive Queries**: Built an interface for asking custom questions\n",
        "11. **Performance Analytics**: Added system statistics and monitoring\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Features:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Semantic Search**: Find relevant content using natural language queries\n",
        "- **Source Attribution**: Get detailed citations and references for answers\n",
        "- **Metadata Integration**: Access paper titles, authors, and other metadata\n",
        "- **Performance Monitoring**: Track search times and system statistics\n",
        "- **Flexible Configuration**: Easy to modify models, chunk sizes, and parameters\n",
        "\n",
        "### Next Steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Experiment** with different queries to explore your document collection\n",
        "2. **Modify** the `custom_question` variable to ask your own questions\n",
        "3. **Adjust** parameters like `chunk_size`, `similarity_top_k` for different results\n",
        "4. **Add** more papers to the `papers/agents` folder and rebuild the index\n",
        "5. **Enhance** the system with additional features like filtering or ranking\n",
        "\n",
        "### Usage Tips:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Use specific, focused questions for better results\n",
        "- Try different phrasings of the same question\n",
        "- Check the source information to understand where answers come from\n",
        "- Experiment with the `similarity_top_k` parameter to get more or fewer sources\n",
