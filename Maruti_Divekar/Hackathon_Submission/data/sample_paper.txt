Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for Healthcare
======================================

Abstract
--------
This is a sample PDF document discussing the applications of RAG in healthcare settings. 
It serves as test data for the deep research system.

1. Introduction
--------------
Recent advancements in language models and information retrieval have led to increased 
interest in RAG systems for healthcare applications. These systems combine the power 
of large language models with domain-specific knowledge retrieval.

2. Methods
---------
- Knowledge base construction from medical literature
- Hybrid retrieval using dense and sparse vectors
- Context-aware generation with citation tracking
- Domain-specific evaluation metrics

3. Results
---------
Initial trials show:
- 95% accuracy in medical fact verification
- 87% retrieval precision for rare conditions
- Reduced hallucination compared to base LLMs
- Improved traceability of medical claims

4. Discussion
------------
Key challenges remain:
- Data freshness and update frequency
- Privacy considerations in medical contexts
- Integration with existing health systems
- Cost-effectiveness at scale
