    "executive_summary": "**Executive Summary**\n\nThis research report investigates the role of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in strengthening national security, particularly within the context of India's border management. Key findings indicate a significant increase in the utilization of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) UAVs, which provide real-time actionable data to enhance military operations and improve border security against insurgent threats. The analysis reveals a shift towards data-driven decision-making in defense strategies, underscoring the importance of real-time intelligence in operational effectiveness. However, the moderate credibility of the sources analyzed necessitates further verification from authoritative references to ensure the reliability of the findings. It is recommended that defense stakeholders prioritize the integration of advanced UAV technologies while also investing in robust source validation processes to inform strategic military planning.",
