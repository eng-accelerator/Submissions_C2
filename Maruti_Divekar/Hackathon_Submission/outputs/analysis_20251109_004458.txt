Key excerpt: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for Healthcare ======================================  Abstract -------- This is a sample PDF document discussing the applications of RAG in healthcare settings.  It serves as test data for the deep research system.  1. Introduction -------------- Recent advancements in language models and information retrieval have led to increased  interest in RAG systems for healthcare applications. These systems combine the power  of large language models with domain-specific knowledge retrieval.  2. Methods --------- - Knowledge base construction from medical literature - Hybrid retrieval using dense and sparse vectors - Context-aware generation with citation tracking - Domain-specific evaluation metrics  3. Results --------- Initial trials show: - 95% accuracy in ...
