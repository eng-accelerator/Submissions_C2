    "executive_summary": "**Executive Summary**\n\nThis research report examines the role of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in enhancing national security, particularly in the context of border surveillance and threat monitoring in India. Key findings indicate a significant increase in the utilization of UAVs for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) operations, underscoring the importance of real-time data collection for informed military decision-making. The analysis reveals a strategic shift towards leveraging advanced technology to bolster border security and agent safety. However, the credibility of the sources analyzed is moderate, necessitating further verification from authoritative references. It is recommended that defense stakeholders prioritize the integration of reliable data sources and invest in the continuous development of UAV capabilities to maximize their effectiveness in national security operations.",
