## Executive Summary

Research Query: What is Artificial Narrow Intelligence
Scope: 1 sources analyzed

=== Analysis Findings ===
=== Source Analysis ===

Source: unknown
Summary: Methods
---------
- Knowledge base construction from medical literature
- Hybrid retrieval using dense and sparse vectors
- Context-aware generation with citation tracking
- Domain-specific evaluation metrics

3. Results
---------
Initial trials show:
- 95% accuracy in medical fact verification
- 87% retrieval precision for rare conditions
- Reduced hallucination compared to base LLMs
- Improved traceability of medical claims

4. ArXiv:2307.09288
Modern RAG implementations often combine dense retrieval with lightweight filtering or hybrid search (e.g., BM25 + embeddings) to improve recall
Credibility: 0.5/1.0 - Generic web source; verify with authoritative sources. - Modern RAG implementations often combine dense retrieval with lightweight filtering or hybrid search (e.g., BM25 + embeddings) to improve recall: Modern RAG implementations often combine dense retrieval with lightweight filtering or hybrid search (e.g., BM25 + embeddings) to improve recall
