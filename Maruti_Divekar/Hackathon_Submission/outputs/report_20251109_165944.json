    "executive_summary": "**Executive Summary**\n\nThis research report investigates the role of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in enhancing national security, particularly in the context of India\u2019s border management against insurgent threats. Key findings indicate a significant increase in the utilization of UAVs for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) purposes, which provide real-time actionable data to inform military operations and improve border security. The analysis reveals a growing reliance on technology-driven strategies within national defense frameworks. However, the sources analyzed exhibit moderate credibility, highlighting the need for further verification from authoritative entities to ensure the reliability of the findings. It is recommended that stakeholders prioritize the validation of data sources and explore the integration of advanced UAV technologies to bolster national security efforts.",
