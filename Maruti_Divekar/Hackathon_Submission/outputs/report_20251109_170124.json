    "executive_summary": "**Executive Summary**\n\nThis research report examines the role of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in enhancing national security, particularly in the context of India's border management against insurgent threats. Key findings indicate an increased utilization of UAVs for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), which provides real-time data critical for informed military operations and bolsters border security. The analysis reveals a significant trend towards technology-driven defense strategies, emphasizing the importance of ISR capabilities in modern warfare. However, the credibility of the sources analyzed is moderate, highlighting the need for further verification from authoritative entities to ensure the reliability of the findings. It is recommended that policymakers prioritize the integration of UAV technology while also investing in robust validation processes to support informed decision-making in national security initiatives.",
