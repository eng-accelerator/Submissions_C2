## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary**

This research report investigates the role of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), specifically Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) UAVs, in enhancing national security. Key findings indicate that ISR UAVs are pivotal in collecting real-time actionable data, which aids armed forces in executing informed military operations. Additionally, these UAVs are increasingly employed across various public sector domains, including law enforcement, agriculture, and urban planning, underscoring their versatility. However, the analysis reveals a moderate reliability of the source, with an average credibility score of 0.50/1.0, highlighting the need for independent verification of data to ensure accuracy in decision-making. Actionable recommendations include prioritizing the establishment of robust data verification processes and further exploration of UAV applications to maximize their potential in both military and civilian contexts.
