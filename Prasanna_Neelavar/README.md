## Introduction

Hello everyone,

I’m excited to be a part of this community. I’m a technologist passionate about solving complex, real-world problems. My current focus is on the Med-Legal tech space, where I work on improving evaluation processes for Personal Injury and Workers’ Compensation cases.

My approach is to build flexible solutions that adapt to unique user workflows. I am now exploring Generative AI to create tools that can automate case intake from documents and help doctors generate comprehensive reports from unstructured notes or voice dictations.

I’m here to learn from all of you and share my experiences in applying technology to solve complex business challenges. I’m looking forward to the discussions and connecting with you all.
