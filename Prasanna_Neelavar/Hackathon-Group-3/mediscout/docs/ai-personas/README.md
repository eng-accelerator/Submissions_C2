## How to Leverage AI Personas

1. **Identify Your Needs:**
   - Choose the persona(s) relevant to your current phase or challenge (e.g., requirements, UX, architecture, coding).

2. **Consult the Persona:**
   - Open the corresponding markdown file to review the persona's expertise, typical tasks, and prompts.
   - Use the suggested prompts to ask questions or request guidance as if consulting a domain expert.

3. **Integrate into Workflow:**
   - During brainstorming, design, or development, refer to personas for:
     - Best practices
     - Checklists
     - Review questions
     - Recommendations
   - Use personas in team discussions to simulate expert input or validate decisions.

4. **Iterate and Collaborate:**
   - Combine insights from multiple personas for cross-functional perspectives.
   - Adapt and extend personas as your project evolves.

## Example Usage

- **Design Phase:**
  - Consult the UX Designer persona for wireframe feedback and usability tips.
- **Development Phase:**
