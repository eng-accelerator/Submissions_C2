    "## Medical Report Summarizer with Gradio UI\n",
    "\n",
    "This code cell builds a complete Gradio application for medical report summarization and text-to-speech conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** To create a user-friendly web interface that allows users to input a medical report, get a summary, and then generate audio for the summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Aspects and Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Import Libraries:** Imports necessary libraries including `gradio`, `transformers`, `torch`, `os`, and `time`.\n",
    "2.  **Configuration:** Sets the Hugging Face model name for summarization and securely retrieves the Hugging Face token using Colab's userdata secrets.\n",
    "3.  **Summarization Functionality:** Defines the `summarize_text` function using a Hugging Face pipeline to generate a summary from the input text.\n",
    "4.  **Export Functionality:** Defines the `export_summary` function to save the generated summary to a text file, making it available for download.\n",
    "5.  **Text-to-Speech Functionality:** Defines the `generate_voice` function, which utilizes the `suno/bark` model to convert the summary text into speech audio. It handles moving the model and inputs to the GPU if available for faster processing.\n",
    "6.  **UI State Management:** Includes the `update_component_states` function to dynamically control the visibility and interactivity of Gradio components (like the export and audio buttons) based on whether a summary has been generated.\n",
    "7.  **Gradio Interface:** Builds the Gradio interface using `gr.Blocks` for flexible layout control. It includes input textboxes, buttons for summarize and clear, output areas for the summary and audio, and a download link for the exported file.\n",
    "8.  **Event Handlers:** Defines the actions that occur when buttons are clicked, linking them to the respective Python functions (`summarize_text`, `export_summary`, `generate_voice`, `update_component_states`).\n",
    "9.  **Launch App:** Launches the Gradio web application, making it accessible via a public URL in the Colab environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup demonstrates a complete workflow from text input to summarized output, audio generation, and file export, all managed within a interactive Gradio interface. The component visibility and interactivity are controlled to provide a guided user experience."
