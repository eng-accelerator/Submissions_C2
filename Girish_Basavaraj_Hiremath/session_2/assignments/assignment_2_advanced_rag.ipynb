They can autonomously engage with external environments, make decisions, and assist humans in various tasks. By incorporating reasoning and planning, agents can adapt their strategies based on new information, ensuring effective decision-making in uncertain situations. Additionally, agents can use different tools to interact with external data sources, enhancing their problem-solving capabilities. Both single-agent and multi-agent systems excel at managing intricate tasks, with multi-agent systems providing advantages in scenarios that demand collaboration and parallel task execution.\n"

Objective metrics include success rate, output similarity to human responses, and overall efficiency. These metrics provide a quantitative assessment of an agent's capabilities. Subjective measures, which are equally important, focus on aspects like the efficiency of tool use, reliability, and robustness of planning. These often require evaluation by human experts, which can be more costly and time-consuming. Additionally, benchmarks like AgentBench and SmartPlay are used to evaluate agents in various environments, providing insights into their ability to generalize and perform tasks involving reasoning, planning, and tool usage. Real-world benchmarks, such as WildBench, also play a role by using data from actual conversations to assess performance across a wide range of tasks.\n",
