    "\n",
    "**What this technique does:**\n",
    "- Filters out retrieved chunks that score below a relevance threshold\n",
    "- Improves response quality by removing \"noise\"\n",
    "- Reduces API costs (fewer tokens sent to LLM)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concept - Postprocessors:**\n",
    "Postprocessors refine retrieval results **after** the initial vector search but **before** sending to the LLM. Think of it as a quality control step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Similarity Filtering Works:**\n",
    "1. Vector search retrieves top 10 chunks\n",
    "2. Each chunk has a similarity score (0.0 to 1.0)\n",
    "3. SimilarityPostprocessor filters out chunks below threshold (e.g., 0.3)\n",
    "4. Only high-quality chunks (score ≥ 0.3) go to the LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Query: \"AI agent architectures\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial retrieval (10 chunks):\n",
    "- Chunk 1: Score 0.85 ✅ (about AI agents - VERY RELEVANT)\n",
    "- Chunk 2: Score 0.72 ✅ (about agent frameworks - RELEVANT)\n",
    "- Chunk 3: Score 0.65 ✅ (about system design - RELEVANT)\n",
    "- Chunk 4: Score 0.28 ❌ (about cooking recipes - NOT RELEVANT)\n",
    "- Chunk 5: Score 0.15 ❌ (about finance - NOT RELEVANT)\n",
    "- ... (5 more low-scoring chunks)\n",
    "\n",
    "After SimilarityPostprocessor (cutoff=0.3):\n",
    "- Only Chunks 1, 2, 3 passed (scores ≥ 0.3)\n",
    "- Result: Cleaner context for LLM, better answers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:**\n",
    "- ✅ Removes irrelevant results that confuse the LLM\n",
    "- ✅ Reduces API costs (fewer tokens)\n",
    "- ✅ Improves answer quality and focus\n",
    "- ✅ Typical cutoff: 0.3 (adjustable based on your needs)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters:**\n",

    "- Changes **how** the LLM combines multiple retrieved chunks into a final answer\n",
    "- Uses hierarchical summarization (like building a tree from bottom to top)\n",
    "- Better for complex analytical questions\n",

    "1. **TreeSummarize** (this cell):\n",
    "   - Builds response hierarchically\n",
    "   - Summarizes pairs of chunks, then summarizes summaries\n",
    "   - Good for: Comprehensive analysis, \"compare X and Y\", long responses\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Refine** (not shown here):\n",
    "   - Iteratively improves answer chunk by chunk\n",
    "   - Good for: Detailed explanations, evolving answers\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **CompactAndRefine** (not shown here):\n",
    "   - Combines chunks first, then refines\n",
    "   - Good for: Balance between quality and speed\n",
    "\n",
    "**How TreeSummarize Works:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Retrieved Chunks: [A, B, C, D]\n",
    "\n",
    "Level 1 (pair summaries):\n",
    "  Summary_AB = Summarize(A, B)\n",
    "  Summary_CD = Summarize(C, D)\n",
    "\n",
    "Level 2 (combine summaries):\n",
    "  Final_Answer = Summarize(Summary_AB, Summary_CD)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Query Types:**\n",
    "- ✅ \"Compare the advantages and disadvantages of X\"\n",
    "- ✅ \"Explain the evolution of Y from early to modern\"\n",
    "- ✅ \"Analyze the relationship between A and B\"\n",
    "- ❌ \"What is X?\" (simple factual - default synthesizer is fine)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:**\n",
    "- ✅ More comprehensive answers for complex queries\n",
    "- ✅ Better synthesis across multiple sources\n",

    "## 📊 Technique 3: Structured Outputs (Pydantic Models)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this technique does:**\n",
    "- Forces LLM to return data in a specific, validated structure\n",
    "- Uses Pydantic models to define the exact output format\n",
    "- Essential for API endpoints, databases, and data pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concept - Structured Outputs:**\n",
    "Instead of free-text responses, you get type-safe, validated data structures that applications can reliably process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem with Free-Text Responses:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Free-text response (unpredictable)\n",
    "response = \"AI agents are systems that can reason. Key capabilities include planning, tool use...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# How do you extract:\n",
    "# - The title?\n",
    "# - List of key points? (parsing is error-prone)\n",
    "# - Applications? (where do they start/end?)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution with Structured Outputs:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Structured response (predictable)\n",
    "response = ResearchPaperInfo(\n",
    "    title=\"AI Agents and Their Capabilities\",\n",
    "    key_points=[\"reasoning\", \"planning\", \"tool execution\"],\n",
    "    applications=[\"autonomous systems\", \"financial analysis\"],\n",
    "    summary=\"AI agents are autonomous systems...\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Easy to use:\n",
    "print(response.title)  # Direct access\n",
    "for point in response.key_points:  # Iterate list\n",
    "    print(point)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pydantic Model Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ResearchPaperInfo(BaseModel):\n",
    "    title: str  # Must be a string\n",
    "    key_points: List[str]  # Must be a list of strings\n",
    "    applications: List[str]  # Must be a list of strings\n",
    "    summary: str  # Must be a string\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:**\n",
    "- ✅ **Predictable outputs** - Always the same structure\n",
    "- ✅ **Type safety** - Pydantic validates data types\n",
    "- ✅ **Easy integration** - Works with databases, APIs, JSON\n",
    "- ✅ **Error prevention** - Catches invalid outputs early\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Cases:**\n",
    "- REST API endpoints (return JSON)\n",
    "- Database inserts (structured records)\n",
    "- Data pipelines (consistent format)\n",

    "- Combines multiple advanced techniques into a single powerful query engine\n",
    "- Similarity filtering **+** TreeSummarize response synthesis\n",

    "\n",
    "**Key Concept - Production RAG Systems:**\n",
    "In real-world applications, you rarely use just one technique. Production RAG systems combine multiple techniques for optimal results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How the Advanced Pipeline Works:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "User Query: \"Analyze AI agent architectures\"\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Step 1: Vector Search\n",
    "    → Retrieve top 10 chunks from vector database\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Step 2: Similarity Filtering (Postprocessor)\n",
    "    → Filter out chunks with score < 0.3\n",
    "    → Result: 5-7 high-quality chunks\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Step 3: TreeSummarize (Response Synthesizer)\n",
    "    → Build hierarchical summary of chunks\n",
    "    → Level 1: Pair-wise summaries\n",
    "    → Level 2: Combine into final answer\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Final Response: Comprehensive, relevant, well-synthesized answer\n",

    "**Benefits of Combining Techniques:**\n",
    "1. **Similarity Filtering** removes noise → Cleaner input for LLM\n",
    "2. **TreeSummarize** builds comprehensive answer → Better output quality\n",
    "3. **Together** → High-quality results + comprehensive analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use this:**\n",
    "- ✅ Production applications (where quality matters)\n",
    "- ✅ Complex analytical queries\n",
    "- ✅ When you need both precision and comprehensiveness\n",
    "- ✅ API endpoints serving end users\n",
    "\n",
    "**When NOT to use this:**\n",
    "- ❌ Simple factual queries (\"What is X?\") - basic RAG is fine\n",
    "- ❌ Extremely cost-sensitive applications - more API calls\n",
