## Missing Files (Intentionally)

### Why no `requirements.txt`?
- This is an n8n workflow (not Python code)
- Dependencies are managed by n8n
- No Python packages to install

### Why no `app.py` or source code?
- Workflow logic is in `workflow.json`
- n8n uses visual workflow editor
- Custom code is embedded in Code nodes within JSON

### Why no `config.json` or `settings.json`?
- Configuration is in n8n UI
- Credentials are stored in n8n's encrypted credential system
- Workflow JSON contains node configurations

### Why no test files?
- Testing is done through n8n's built-in execution testing
- Real data testing (with actual emails) is documented in SETUP.md
- No separate test suite needed for workflow automation

## Final Notes

**This project demonstrates:**
- Modern workflow automation (n8n)
- Human-AI collaboration (strategic human + technical AI)
- Systems thinking (architecture, error handling, optimization)
