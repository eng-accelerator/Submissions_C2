## Development Details
A powerful Streamlit application that analyzes log files using AI (OpenAI) to identify errors, provide root cause analysis, and suggest actionable solutions. The app also includes notification agents for Slack and JIRA integration.

## ✨ Features

- **📤 Log File Upload**: Upload and analyze log files (.log, .txt, .out, .err)
- **🤖 AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses OpenAI GPT-4 to analyze errors and provide insights
- **🔍 Error Detection**: Automatically identifies error patterns, exceptions, and failures
- **💡 Smart Solutions**: Provides 3 actionable solutions with step-by-step instructions
- **📊 Interactive UI**: Clean, modern interface with tabbed navigation
- **📢 Slack Integration**: Send error notifications directly to Slack channels
- **🎫 JIRA Integration**: Create JIRA tickets automatically with error details

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ (tested with Python 3.14)
- OpenAI API key
- (Optional) Slack webhook URL for notifications
- (Optional) JIRA credentials for ticket creation

### Installation

1. **Clone or navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd ai-accelerator-group2
   ```

2. **Activate your virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   # or
   myenv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables (optional):**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your API keys
   ```

5. **Verify your environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python check_environment.py
   ```
   This will check if all required packages are installed correctly.

6. **Run the Streamlit app:**
   
   **Option 1: Use the startup script (recommended):**
   ```bash
   ./run_app.sh
   ```
   
   **Option 2: Manual activation:**
   ```bash
   # Make sure virtual environment is activated
   source myenv/bin/activate
   
   # Verify you're using the correct Python
   which python  # Should show: .../myenv/bin/python
   
   # Run Streamlit
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

7. **Open your browser:**
   The app will automatically open at `http://localhost:8501`

**⚠️ Important:** If you get a "JIRA package is not installed" error, make sure:
- Your virtual environment is activated (`source myenv/bin/activate`)
- You're running Streamlit from within the activated environment
- The Python path shown in the error matches your virtual environment path

## ⚙️ Configuration

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Error Analyzer
- Uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for cost-effective analysis
- Extracts error lines using keyword matching
- Provides structured JSON responses with:
  - Error type and severity
  - Root cause analysis
  - 3 actionable solutions with code examples

### Notification Agents

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Please enter your OpenAI API key"
- Enter your API key in the sidebar
- Or set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env` file

### "Failed to connect to JIRA"
- Verify JIRA server URL
- Check email and API token are correct
- Ensure API token is valid (not expired)

### "Slack notification failed"
- Verify webhook URL is correct
- Check Slack webhook is active
- Ensure channel permissions allow webhooks

### Analysis takes too long
- Large log files may take longer
- Check your OpenAI API quota
- Try analyzing smaller log files first
