# 🔬 Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Feature Guide

## Overview

The RCA Agent is the 6th agent in the Multi-Agent DevOps Incident Suite, providing **formal, enterprise-grade Root Cause Analysis** for all incidents.

## 🎯 What is RCA?

Root Cause Analysis is a systematic investigation methodology used to identify the underlying reasons for incidents. Instead of just treating symptoms, RCA helps you:
- Identify the real cause of problems
- Prevent similar incidents in the future
- Create actionable preventive measures
- Document lessons learned

## 🔬 RCA Agent Components

### 1. Executive Summary & Problem Statement
- **Executive Summary**: High-level overview for stakeholders
- **Problem Statement**: Clear, concise description of what went wrong
- **Metadata**: Incident ID, timestamp, issue counts, severity

### 2. Five Whys Analysis
- Systematic drilling down to root cause
- 5 levels of "Why?" questions
- Focuses on the primary critical issue
- Reveals hidden systemic problems

### 3. Root Causes Identification
- Multiple root causes may exist
- Each cause includes:
  - Description of the root cause
  - Evidence from logs
  - Impact assessment

### 4. Contributing Factors
- Things that made the incident worse
- Environmental or systemic issues
- Resource constraints
- Process gaps

### 5. Impact Assessment
- **User Impact**: How end-users were affected
- **Business Impact**: Revenue, reputation, SLAs
- **Technical Impact**: Systems and services affected
- **Duration**: How long the incident lasted
- **Severity**: P1-P4 priority level

### 6. Immediate Actions
- Steps to take right now
- Prioritized by severity
- Taken from remediation agent's recommendations
- Actionable and specific

### 7. Preventive Measures
- Long-term solutions to prevent recurrence
- Process improvements
- Technical enhancements
- Monitoring and alerting improvements
- Training recommendations

### 8. Lessons Learned
- Key takeaways for the team
- What worked well
- What needs improvement
- Knowledge to share organization-wide

### 9. Timeline
- Chronological sequence of events
- Shows how the incident unfolded
- Helps identify critical moments
- Useful for post-mortem discussions

## 🤖 How the RCA Agent Works

### With LLM (AI-Enhanced)
When an API key is provided (OpenAI or OpenRouter):
1. **Executive Summary**: AI generates 2-3 sentence overview
2. **Problem Statement**: AI creates clear problem description
3. **Five Whys**: AI performs systematic 5 Whys analysis
4. **Root Causes**: AI identifies 3-5 distinct root causes with evidence
5. **Contributing Factors**: AI finds systemic issues
6. **Impact Assessment**: AI evaluates user, business, and technical impact
7. **Preventive Measures**: AI suggests 5-7 specific improvements
8. **Lessons Learned**: AI extracts 3-5 key takeaways

### Without LLM (Rule-Based)
When no API key is provided:
1. Uses pattern matching and categorization
2. Groups issues by category
3. Generates structured but simpler analysis
4. Still provides all RCA components
5. Good for quick analysis without AI costs

## 💡 How to Use RCA Results

### 1. For Incident Response Teams
- Review Executive Summary first
- Focus on Immediate Actions
- Check Impact Assessment
- Follow remediation plans
