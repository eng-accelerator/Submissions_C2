Advantages and Disadvantages of Nuclear Energy

Advantages:
1. Low Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Nuclear power produces minimal CO2 compared to fossil fuels.
2. High Energy Density: A small amount of nuclear fuel can produce a large amount of energy.
3. Reliability: Nuclear plants provide stable base-load power and operate continuously for long periods.
4. Energy Security: Reduces dependence on imported fossil fuels.

Disadvantages:
1. Radioactive Waste: Nuclear reactors produce waste that remains hazardous for thousands of years.
2. High Costs: Construction and decommissioning of nuclear plants are expensive.
3. Risk of Accidents: Incidents like Chernobyl and Fukushima highlight potential dangers.
4. Limited Fuel Supply: Uranium resources are finite and require careful management.
