Nuclear Safety and Waste Management

Safety Measures:
Modern nuclear reactors are designed with multiple safety systems, including containment structures, emergency cooling systems, and automated shutdown mechanisms. Regulatory bodies enforce strict safety standards and conduct regular inspections.

Waste Management:
Nuclear waste is categorized into low, intermediate, and high-level waste. High-level waste, primarily spent fuel, is highly radioactive and requires secure storage. Methods include:
- On-site storage in cooling pools and dry casks.
- Geological disposal in deep underground repositories.
- Reprocessing to extract usable materials and reduce waste volume.

Challenges:
Long-term waste containment, public opposition, and political hurdles complicate waste management efforts. Research continues into safer and more sustainable solutions.
